- Above in the folder called Inventor_cam_mounts there are some Inventor files that can be edited to fit other cameras
- There is also a folder called STL_cam_mounts this has the camera mounts in STL format ready to be sliced for your printer

### Assembling the cam mount
- The design uses a small chanel to align the two halves
- An M5 bolt is used with the head on the cone side, A square nut can be used in the cutout to thread the bolt into, or a nut can be placed ontop of the wall
