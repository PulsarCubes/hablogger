## Overview

## Process

### Pre-work / pre-launch
- Build payloads
  - Add camera mounts in the payload (top and side)
  - Mount external temp sensor and route wires to the logger
  - Mount VHF antennas / dowell rods

  - Program tracker
    - VHF APRS
    - HF WSPR
    - Other?
  - Charge battery packs
  - Load batteries in the battery holders for the tracker and data logger
  - Test cams
  - Make rigging lines for filling and safety
    - Two tethers for filling and moving to flight pad
    - rigging for payload attachment
  - Load everything needed for launch
  - Weather check / go no go
  - Prediciton calculation / go no go
  - Validate location of launch based on wind prediciton
  
- Day of launch
  - Weather check / go no go
  - Prediciton calculation / go no go
  - Setup filling station
    - Stake tarp
    - Unload tanks
    - Ground tank
