# Amateur Radio In This Project

## Goals
To track the High Altitude Baloon, Amateur Radio is leveraged.  There are other tracking optinos not requiring a license but one of the goals is:
 - Introduce amateur radio to students and educators
 - Demonstrate the benefits of Amateur Radio beyond the baloon project, such as being able to communicate during emergencies
 -Show students there are Amater Radio scholarships available, if they obtain their license.

## Overview
Amateur Radio is utilize to track and collect real-time flight telemetry information of the High Altitude Baloon, and then to locate the payload once it has landed.  Tracking via Amateur Radio can be performed via two means:
- Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)
- Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) (pronounced whisper)

## Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)

APRS is an amateur radio-based system for real time digital communication of information of immediate and local value.  Data can include object Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, weather station data, text messages, announcements, queries, and other telemetry information that needs to be reported. APRS data can be displayed and viewed on a map, which can show stations, objects, tracks of moving objects, weather stations, search and rescue data, to be used to perform direction.

APRS was designed to support rapid, reliable exchange of information for local, tactical real-time information, events or communication nets.  The technology was developed in the mid 1980s, and is designed with communicating all relevant information immediately to everyone (and all stations) so that the infomration is consistent for all participants.  Information communicated is refreshed at regular intervals, with a primary objective of consistent display of information.  APRS uses standard formats not only for the transmission of POSITION, STATUS, MESAAGES and QUERIES, but also map objects such as vehicles and stations.  Because it is a shared communication medium or resource, it also established guidelines on use, and how often stations should checkin and report information.

The two images below should give you an idea of the kinds of information available to the operator on a APRS radio. On the left is the Kenwood D710 radio showing the station list, and on the right is the attached GPS map display showing the location of other APRS stations.
