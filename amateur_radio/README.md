# Amateur Radio In This Project

## Goals
To track the High Altitude Balloon, Amateur Radio is leveraged.  There are other tracking options that do not require a license, but among the goals are:
 - Introduce Amateur Radio to students and educators
 - Introduce new types of wireless communication with hands-on learning
 - Demonstrate the benefits of Amateur Radio beyond the balloon project, such as being able to communicate during emergencies
 - Show students there are Amateur Radio scholarships available, if they obtain their license.

## Overview
Amateur Radio, also known as Ham Radio, is the use of radio communications for the purposes of non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, private recreation, and emergency communications.

Amateur Radio is utilized by the project to track and collect real-time flight telemetry information from the High Altitude Balloon, and locating the payload after landing.  HAB tracking via Amateur Radio is performed commonly via two means:
- Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)
- Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) (pronounced whisper)

Each option has benefits and limitations, depending on the types of balloon and the tracking goals.

## Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)

APRS is a real time digital communication system that allows participants to share information, including position infromation, and other information about their locale that has 'immediate value' to all participants.

In its widest implementation, APRS communication occurs using VHF radios, with messages relayed to other stations, including repeaters on the ground, which can deliver the locale and telemetry infromation to APRS internet sites that allow users to view a map of APRS objects.

APRS works well for tracking goals of:
- High accuracy tracking is required (such as for payload retrival)
- Expected flight path is within local or regional area
- Expected flight path does NOT cross ocean or international waters
- Expected flight of balloon is rise to a max altitude and immediately return to earth
- Expected flight duration is a few hours or days


## Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR)

WSPR (prounced "whisper") is a protocol designed for weak-signal radio communication.  It is commonly used to by amateur radio operators for sending and recieving very low-power transmissions to test propagatino path on the Medium Frequency (MF) and High Frequency (HF) bands.  The protocol is designed and written initially by Joe Taylor (K1JT) and uses open source software developed and supported by  small team.  WSPR transmission, similiar to APRS, use a standard message format, carrying the station's call sign, Madienhead grid locator, and transmitter power in dBm.  The program decodes signals with a signal-to-noise (SNR) as low as -28 dB, with stations sending reports to online central database called WSPRnet, which includes mapping.
