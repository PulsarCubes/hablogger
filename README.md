# High altitude Balloon (HAB) Logger

## This is a STEM project meant to introduce the following:

- Microcontrollers / electronics basics
  - Arduino and Raspberry Pico lessons included
- Introduction to coding concepts
  - Variants in C and Python aailable
- Test the finished product in a high altitude balloon flight to the stratosphere (60-125k feet)
- Collect telemetry data during the flight
- Analyze collected data

Lessons will be broken up into short lessons students can work on by themselves or in small groups. 

### Lessons:

- Introduction and how to get started
  - Details about high altitude balloons
  - Introduction to electronics and components used in the project
- Blinking lights
  - Traditional first project with microcontrollers getting students comfortable with breadboards, components, microcontrollers, and loading code to the device 
- Working with the weather sensor
  - Wiring up sensors to read temperature and barometric pressure
- Working with the GPS module
  - Wiring up GPS hardware to the microcontroller and reading satellite telemetry
- Working with the SD card module
  - Wire up SD card hardware and writing a file to the card
- Putting it all together
  - Wire everything up and see telemetry data logging to the SD card
- Analyzing telemetry and log data
  - Samples to interpret flight data
