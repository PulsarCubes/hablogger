### Workbench to contain all the electronics needed for classroom use

## Background

- This was created by a student from our first launch who later interned with the STEM team
- Research was done looking at similar projects on [thingverse.com](https://thingverse.com/)
  - We found some that were close but either wouldnt take the expected classroom abuse or had the chance of loosing components
  - Static was a big concern as well with students handling components and replacing them in the plastic or cardboard kit boxes
- The idea we had was to create somehting similar to a compartment box with compartments for each component, have standoffs to screw the components in, storage for jumper wires, and a location for the breadboard.
